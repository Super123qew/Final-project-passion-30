# Final-project-passion-30

## Description: 

ROBLOX is an online platform where developer(s) can create their own game that is publicly playable by coding in Luau ("Dialect" of Lua) Script and using custom or premade models with backing code scripts and modules. Our idea is to create a game with a central theme of a tower defence simulator.

## Theme: [Reference to what genre our game is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense)

Our game has classes of enemies who get stronger as the game progresses and who travel along a set path until they reach the end and deduct health for getting past the defences. Players place mini troops placed anywhere except on the path who attack the enemies until they are dead. These mini troops have unique ways to attack i.e. a grenade troop does area damage whereas a sniper will do maximum damage against one enemy. The concept is further explained in our Figma design

## Week-by-week work:

### Week 1:

- Created our proposal for our game, a ROBLOX game with the genre of a tower defence simulator
- Divide work amongst Justin and Dante to see who does what
- Brainstorm a central theme for our game that sets it apart from others
- Learned some basic Lua functions for the new programming language
- Work on some sketches of our game on a Figma 
- Begin preliminary work for our game

### Week 2:

- Finalized concept of our game on Figma document
- Searched up some tutorials on our game type to learn how to create it
- Created the prototype on ROBLOX
- Implemented map design
- Implemented extremely basic mob spawning/movement

### Week 3:

- Implemented raycasting for troop placement, enemy info selection, and upgrade.
- Created a tower that targets and destroys enemies

### Week 4:

- Implemented tower placement
- Implemented different mob and troop types
- Implemented base with set health
- Implemented custom models for troops
- Basic GUI for troop selection created
- Ported source code into GitHub and created pseudocode
- Attempted basic database system for the game
- Basic money system created

## Future plans/reflections

- Made map more visually appealing
- Implement sound effects in the game
- Create a lobby area before playing
- Map selection/vote before gameplay
- Troop selection for different playstyles
- Implement tower "animations" (They just turn toward the enemy when attacking)
- Shop system for buying troops/power-ups

Despite our initial optimism, many mechanics never made it past the drawing board as the syntax for LUAU in the dev console was extremely foreign for us. Despite this, we felt that we made great strides in our knowledge of Lua and felt accomplished in that we made something.
