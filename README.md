## Description: 

ROBLOX is an online platform where creator(s) can create their own game that is publicly playable by coding in Lua Script and using custom or premade models. Our idea is to create a game with a central theme of a tower defence simulator.

## Week-by-week work:

### Week 1:

- Created our proposal for our game, a ROBLOX game with the genre of a tower defense simulator
- Divide work amongst Justin and Dante to see who does what
- Brainstorm a central theme for our game that sets it apart from others
- Learned some basic Lua functions for the new programming language
- Work on some sketches of our game on a figma 
- Begin prelimenary work for our game


## Future work/plans
