# Final-project-passion-30

## Description: 

ROBLOX is an online platform where creator(s) can create their own game that is publicly playable by coding in Lua Script and using custom or premade models. Our idea is to create a game with a central theme of a tower defence simulator.

## Theme: [Reference to what genre our game is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense)

Our game has classes of enemies who get stronger as the game progresses and who travel along a set path until they reach the end and deduct health for getting past the defenses. Players place mini troops placed anywhere except on the path who attack the enemies until they are dead. These mini troops have unique ways to attack i.e. a grenade troop does area damage whereas a sniper will do maximum damage against one enemy. The concept is further explained in our figma design

- [ ]  Special enemy type(s) made  **(CUT)**



## Week-by-week work:

### Week 1:

- Created our proposal for our game, a ROBLOX game with the genre of a tower defense simulator
- Divide work amongst Justin and Dante to see who does what
- Brainstorm a central theme for our game that sets it apart from others
- Learned some basic Lua functions for the new programming language
- Work on some sketches of our game on a figma 
- Begin prelimenary work for our game

### Week 2:

- Finalized concept of our game on figma document
- Searched up some tutorials on our game type to learn how to create it
- Created the prototype on ROBLOX
- Implemented map design
- Implemented extremely basic mob spawning/movement

### Week 3:

- Implemented raycasting for troop placement, enemy info selection, troop upgrade, etc.
- Created tower that targets and destroys enemies


## Future plan/reflection

- Implemented sounds effects in the game
- Create a lobby area before playing
- Map selection/vote before gameplay
- Troop selection for different playstyles
- Shop system for buying troops/power ups

Despite our initial optimism alot of the mechanics never made it past the drawing board as the syntax for LUA in the dev console was extremely foreign for us. Despite this, we felt that we made great strides in our knowledge on Lua and feel accomplished we actually made something.
