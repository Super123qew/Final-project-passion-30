# Ideal analysis (Assuming all core ideas are implemented)

Our game contains alot of different script files that call on eachother for different usecases. Our game should utilize these files by calling each other to to perform specific tasks I.E main script files calls on mob file to spawn enemies during a wave. Enemy spawning is accomplished by copying the files of the mob over to the "workspace" (Viewable) section of the code depending on what mob is needed. If mobs succesfuly run the entire path, their remaining health is subtracted from the "Base" health of the player(s). Our Gui is easily integrated within the Studio workshop as it allows placement of interfaces on screen without any scripting required. Some of these GUI elemenets would be linked within our main file displaying things such as wave, time, health, etc.  CLicking buttons with troop icons allow placement of troops anywhere on map (Excluding path and map boundry) with a certain cost. Utilizing mouse raycasting clicking on a troop opens a menu allowing for upgrades that boost stats for money. Using a database system it should display the amount of wins a person has depending on if you win or not. Troops would work by selecting the nearest mob than attacking until its dead, leaves the range of it, or reaches the end of the path.
